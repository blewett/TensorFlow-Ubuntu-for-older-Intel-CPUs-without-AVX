# tensorflow-non-avx-ubuntu-20
This github entry includes scripts and pointers to python wheel[s] file[s] for using tensorflow on old Intel computers.  This work was currently performed on Ubuntu 20.04 using the directions from the Tensorflow web site.

Those instructions are very complete and can be completed given some patience.

As the process for creating a new wheel file for use with python is fairly tedious, a pointer to our wheel file is provided with a checksum script for verifying the file.
